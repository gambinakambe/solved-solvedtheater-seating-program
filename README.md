The theaterâ€™s auditorium has 10 rows of seats with 9 seats in each row. The program should display a screen that shows which seats are available and which are taken. The screen will show a chart depicting each seat in the theater.Seats that are taken are represented by an * symbol, and seats that are available are represented by a # symbol.Every time a ticket or group of tickets is purchased, the program should display the total ticket prices and update the seating chart. The program should keep a total of all ticket sales.The program should also give the user an option to see a list of how many seats have been sold, how many seats are available in each row, and how many seats are available in the entire auditorium.
